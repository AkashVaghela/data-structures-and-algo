# Stacks operations (LIFO)

lookup O(n)
Push O(1)
Pop O(1)
peek O(1)

# Queues operations (FIFO)

lookup O(n)
enqueues O(1)
dequeues O(1)
peek O(1)

- Stacks and queues can be build using arrays or linked lists
- Javascript does not have their own stacks and queues.
- Stacks can be build using arrays or linked lists depending on the requirments.
- Queues should not be build using arrays. It is good idea to build queues using linked lists.

# Advantages of Stacks + Queues

- Fast operations
- Fast peek
- ordered

# Disadvantages of Stacks + Queues

- slow lookups
