# Binary search tree (Balanced)

lookup O(log N)

# Advantages of BST

- Better than O(n)
- ordered
- flexible size

# Disadvantages of BST

- no O(1) operations

**perfect binary tree**
A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level. Perfect Binary Tree.

**full Binary tree**
A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children. It is also known as a proper binary tree.

**Binary search tree**
In a Binary search tree, the value of left node must be smaller than the parent node, and the value of right node must be greater than the parent node.

**balanced binary tree**
A balanced binary tree is a binary tree that follows the 3 conditions:

- The height of the left and right tree for any node does not differ by more than 1.
- The left subtree of that node is also balanced.
- The right subtree of that node is also balanced.

**unbalanced binary tree**

An unbalanced binary tree is a type of binary tree data structure where the nodes of the tree are arranged in a way that one subtree has a greater number of nodes than the other subtree.

**Log**
The power (or exponent) to which one base number must be raised (multiplied by itself) to produce another number.

log(10)100 = 2 because 10 \* 10 = 100
