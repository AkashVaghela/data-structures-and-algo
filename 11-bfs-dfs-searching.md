# dfs & bfs searching

# common types of searching/ traversals

- linear serching
- binary searching
- DFS (depth first search)
- BFS (breath first search)

# Advantages of BFS

- shortest path
- closer nodes

# Disadvantages of BFS

- more memory

# Advantages of DFS

- less memory
- does path exist?

# Disadvantages of DFS

- can get slow

### ways to implement DFS

-->

- inorder => 1, 4, 6, 9, 15, 20, 170
- preorder => 9, 4, 1, 6, 20, 15, 170
- postorder => 1, 6, 4, 15, 170, 20, 9

- BFS => to find shortest path
- DFS => check to see if it exists

<!-- algo to find shortest paths -->

# Dijkstra algo

# Bellman-ford algo
