- Play around with linkedlist[https://visualgo.net/en/list]

- Java has inbuilt linked list.
- Javascript does not have built in linked list.

**Linked lists**

prepand O(1)
append O(1)
lookup (traversal) O(n)
insert O(n)
delete O(n)

# Pointer:

It is a reference to a memory address.

# Garbage collection:

Javascript automatically removes unreferenced items in the memory

- Javascript manages memory for us where as in low level languages like C we manually have to add and remove memory.

# Advantages of LinkedList

- Fast insertion
- Fast deletion
- ordered
- flexible size

# Disadvantages of LinkedList

- slow lookups
- more memory
