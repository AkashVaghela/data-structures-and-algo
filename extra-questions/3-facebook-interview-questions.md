If you would like to practice real life interview questions asked by Facebook, then here they are below. Keep in mind that it will be hard to just get everything right from the beginning. With enough practice you will become better and better, but there is an entire community of us learning, so I recommend you tackle these questions together with our online Discord community (see lesson #3 in this course for the link) and join the conversation and tackle problems in the #**interview-questions** channel:
