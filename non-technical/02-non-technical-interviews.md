# before an interview

- mindset: no interview is a do or die or a last change. if you do not perform well in an interview that is not the end. take it as a learning experience. do not appear in an interview for a just job, it can be an opportunity to learn about your strength or weaknesses, about company etc...

**common question**

1. tell me about yourself

- it should be around a minute
- your triggers of success (past projects, past comapnies)
- mention things you want to get asked
- skills should be relevant to job

2. why do you want to work with us?

- show you want to grow
- demonstrate why you are the best

3. why did you leave your job? (follow up que.)

- be more positive (want to work with better people, big projects etc...)
- no negativity (manager/ co-workers were not good)

4. tell me about a problem + how you solved?

situation (what was the problem?) => action (what did you do?) => result (how did it help?)

- have this prepared
- have metrics and numbers
- scaling, performance, security

5. tell me about an interesting project? (follow up que.)

- show them how you are different
- relate it to this job

6. what is your biggest weakness?

- real answer
- show how you improved it?

7. any question for us?

- focus on them, not company (
  mistake you made within first month of the job,
  where do you see company in next 3 5 years?,
  why did you join this comapny?,
  have you seen your skills grown in past years?,
  what you wish you were told when you joined the comapny?)
- mention something they mentioned

**interviewer wants answer to these questions**

1. can you do the job?
2. can I work with you?
3. are you going to improve?

**4 qualities they are looking for:**

1. technical (tell them story about your personal projects or past projects)
2. success (tell them story about getting promotion on previous job or building something which is being used by others)
3. leadership (tell them story when you took the charge of a situation)
4. challenge (tell them story when you were given a very difficult problem and how you overcame it)

# extra tips

- simplicity over complexity
- premature optimization is root of all evil
- overall goal, not myopic
- no complain about client/code/etc...
- no ego

# after the interview

- thank interviewer
- ask for a feedback
- when will i hear back from them
- closing statement (don't overuse 'I', talk about interviwer, do not brag)
