# sorting

- sorting and searching are two of the most challenging aspects of a software engineering.

# some popular sorting algorithms are:

### comparison sorts

**elementary algos with O(n^2)**

- bubble sort
- selection sort
- insertion sort

**advanced algos with O(n log n)**

- merge sort
- quick sort

### non-comparison sorts

- only usefull for limited range of integers but they can perform better than O(n log n)

- counting sort
- redix sort
